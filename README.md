# Connect Four Game

## Overview

This project is an implementation of the classic Connect Four game, developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). The game is built in Ruby and follows the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The goal of the game is for two players to take turns dropping colored discs into a seven-column, six-row grid. The winner is the first player to connect four of their discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend in a local multiplayer setting.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically checks for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal connections to determine the winner.
- **TDD Approach**: The entire development process was driven by tests.
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/connect-four.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd connect-four
    ```

3. Run the game:
    ```bash
    ruby connect_four.rb
    ```

## Testing

This project was developed using TDD with RSpec. To run the tests:

1. Install the necessary gems:
    ```bash
    bundle install
    ```

2. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    rspec
    ```

## Lessons Learned

This project was an excellent opportunity to practice TDD and deepen my understanding of RSpec.
